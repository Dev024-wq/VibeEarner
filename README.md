# VibeEarning — Insurance Agent Recruitment Website

## Overview

This repository contains the **VibeEarning Insurance Agent Recruitment Website**, a modern, mobile-first platform for candidate onboarding, created *entirely by prompting Perplexity AI*. Every feature described here—including code, structure, accessibility, and content—was made possible through step-by-step AI-guided prompts, making this a 100% Perplexity-powered build. Whether you’re browsing, contributing, or learning, this README covers all project details and highlights the **power of AI prompting** in web development.

## 🚀 Built 100% Through Perplexity Prompting

Every single aspect of this project was crafted by describing my needs, ideas, and bugs to Perplexity and using the resulting prompts and code—**no external templates or prior codebase was used**!

**How Perplexity contributed to every part:**

- **Page structure & layout:** I asked Perplexity for accessible, semantic HTML5 for every page, section, and element.
- **Navigation & mobile menu:** Through prompting, Perplexity provided a responsive header and an animated hamburger menu, including accessibility (ARIA roles and keyboard nav).
- **Modern CSS / theme:** All CSS, variable setups, breakpoints, and advanced effects (shadows, animations, card transitions) were generated and revised through iterative prompts.
- **Animated steps, stats, and hero:** The home and join pages use engaging cards and motion, designed entirely from AI code and tweaks.
- **Express Interest form:** I described my contact form needs, validation behavior, and user guidance, then let Perplexity do the markup, styling, and JS for reset/clear.
- **Legal compliance:** For requirements about eligibility and joining (age, education, exam, etc.), I asked Perplexity to review and include content referring to industry regulations.
- **About, FAQ, Legal pages:** With each request (e.g. “Animated FAQ cards,” “testimonials grid,” “disclaimer section”), Perplexity wrote concise, engaging content and all supporting HTML/CSS.
- **Accessibility improvements:** All ARIA, tab order, and focus outline fixes originated directly from my explicit prompts to Perplexity (“make it accessible,” “improve form for screen readers,” etc.).
- **Debugging & Syntax:** Any VS Code or browser error I faced ("colon expected", "unexpected end of input", layout issues, etc.) I described directly in my prompts, and Perplexity provided exact, valid code/diff for each fix.
- **Mobile-first & Responsive:** I highlighted mobile navigation/panels/cards, and Perplexity delivered CSS to ensure seamless experience on all devices. 
- **README and documentation:** Even this README was drafted via prompt!
